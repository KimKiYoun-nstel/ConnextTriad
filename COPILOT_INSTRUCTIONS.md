# Copilot Project Instructions

## Cross-References (for Copilot context)
- For high-level module boundaries and data flow, see `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- For detailed coding rules and examples, see `CODING_GUIDELINES.md`.
- For NGVA/DDS compliance specifics and Connext usage constraints, see `DOMAIN_STANDARDS.md`.
- For authoritative Topic/Type and Command specs, see `TOPICS_AND_COMMANDS.md`.

## Language Policy (MUST)
- Default language for all Copilot Chat responses and generated natural-language text is **Korean**.
- Write all comments, docstrings, and human-facing documentation in **Korean**.
- Keep code identifiers and third-party API names in **English** (e.g., type/function/class/enum names, DDS/NGVA terms).
- User-facing strings (UI labels, log/error messages) should be **Korean** unless a spec requires otherwise.
- When in doubt, prefer **Korean narrative + English code tokens**.

## Environment
- OS: Windows
- IDE: Visual Studio 2022
- Build system: CMake
- Language: Classic C++ (C++03/C++11 제한적)

## Style
- Follow Google C++ Style Guide with project-specific `.clang-format`.
- 4-space indentation, max line length 120.
- Pointer alignment: attach `*` to type (`int* p`).
- Tabs are not allowed, only spaces.
- All functions, classes, and member structures must include meaningful comments.

## Framework & Standards
- Middleware: RTI Connext DDS 7.5.x
- All designs must strictly comply with **NGVA** and **DDS** standards.  
- Do not introduce code that violates DDS or NGVA design principles.

## Development Rules
- Do not build or run tests unless explicitly requested.  
- Before adding new functionality:
  - Check if the same or similar functionality already exists.  
  - If it does, prefer reuse or modification.  
  - Avoid duplication of logic or features.  
- All public and private APIs must be documented.  
- Every class, function, and member variable requires comments explaining its **purpose** or **meaning**.

## Documentation Guidelines
- Use **Doxygen-style comments** for classes, functions, and members.

## DDS Code Generation Policy
- All `.idl` files under `types/` are **source files** and must be committed to version control.
- Code generated by `rtiddsgen` (e.g., `*.cxx`, `*Plugin.*`, `*Support.*`) is **not committed**; these are build artifacts.
- Never modify generated files manually. If changes are required, update the `.idl` file and regenerate.
- Copilot must not suggest edits to generated code. Instead, guide modifications through the corresponding IDL definition.
- DDS generated headers (`generated/*.h`) may be used by Copilot to infer data types and structures.  
- DDS generated sources (`*.cxx`, `*Plugin.*`, `*Support.*`) are ignored and must not be modified or referenced directly.  
- Always edit `.idl` files for schema changes, then regenerate code.

## Copilot Context Hints
- Prefer reading `generated/*.h` to infer data types; avoid referencing `generated/*.cxx`, `*Plugin.*`, `*Support.*`.
- When proposing new features, search for similar functionality in `RtpDdsGateway/include/` and `DkmRtpIpc/include/` before generating new code.
- Avoid running builds/tests unless explicitly requested.
- Treat `TOPICS_AND_COMMANDS.md` as the single source of truth for topics/types and UI↔DDS commands; follow it when proposing code.
